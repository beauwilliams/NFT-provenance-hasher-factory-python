#  NFT_provenance_hasher_factory_python


Use this tool to create provenance hashes of your NFT collections to assure your users that the randomisation of your drop has not been manipulated in any way.

Simply edit the file to match number of NFTs, where your NFT data is kept on your local machine.

You will receive back two output files. 1. As list of hashes 2. A concatenated hash of all the hashes, known as the provenance hash.

You shall only need to supply your users with the provenance hash before doing a delay reveal mint.
